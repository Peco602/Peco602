I also received a M.Sc. Degree in "Advanced Communication and Navigation Satellite Systems" in 2015 and got a Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering at the University of Roma "Tor Vergata" in 2019. Since 2013 I have worked at the Italian Space Control Center firstly as Head of Spacecraft Operations and then as responsible of Space Platform Engineering. I am a Spacecraft Operations Engineer qualified for all SICRAL GEO satellites and for the OPTSAT 3000 LEO satellite. Since 2019 I have been employed by the Italian Ministry of Defence as a Cyber Security Engineer and then as Head of Cyberspace Operations at the Joint Command for Cyberspace Operations. I obtained the GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH) and the Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE) certifications and I joined the GIAC Advisory Board.
